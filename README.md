# DenseNet121-kers2-version
This is the implementation of DenseNet121 using Keras version 2 which is updated from the repo from here https://github.com/flyyufelix/DenseNet-Keras

The notebook file in this repo holds the Keras 2 version of the DenseNet121 with little modification from the original repo provided above. Anyone who wants to manipulate the architecture can follow the notebook. I have modified the architecture for preserving the width of my input image from being reduced tooo much by changing the pooling stride size at differnt blocks as per my problem domaun.
